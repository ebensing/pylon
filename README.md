Pylon - Lightweight Code Deployment
===================

Pylon is a lightweight code deployment tool based on git. It is meant to make
deploying code updates across lots of machines simple.

This is a work in progress. EDIT: It's basically done, but I need to add
documentation at some point. We'll do that when I get un-lazy.
